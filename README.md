# Biome Hat

Knitting chart generator for the Biome Hat; a hat that uses simplex noise as a colourwork pattern.

## Simplex noise

Simplex noise is a clustered randomness algorithm. When translated into knit stitches it produces a colourwork pattern with an organic look. The chart generator uses a new noise pattern each time the page is visited, creating a unique hat chart.

Unlike many traditional knitting patterns, there are no section repeats. The knitting chart shows the pattern in full. The lack of repeats does mean the pattern requires more focus when knitting, however, the upside is that any mistakes in following the pattern are barely noticeable.
